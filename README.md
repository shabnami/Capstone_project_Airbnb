Overview:
Airbnb(Air bed and breakfast)
Airbnb is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. 
Since Airbnb has started more people are using the platform to list their house/apartment/room? for short term rent. The host can rent the place from one night to months. Sometimes the host will rent their house when they are away for a week. 

Business Objective:

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis that they wouldn?t have done otherwise?

The challenge that the host face is finding the right price for their listing. One way they can do it is by searching similar places and see what are those listed as and then estimate a price for their listing but this is not accurate and it does not include all the information. (for example the user may think only number of bedrooms is important whereas there are many factors in predicting the price)
So having a tool for predicting the listing price of an Airbnb that takes into consideration several factor (location, number of bedrooms, time of the year for listing,..) would help the host estimate their listing.
